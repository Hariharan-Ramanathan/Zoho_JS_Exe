6. Create a Page with buttons "Move" & "Pause" & "Reset" and an image(Say , Zoho logo).  When the "Move" button is clicked , the image should travel in a "+" trajectory. When clicked on "Pause" button , the image should stop moving and stay where it is. "Reset" button should send the image to its initial position.
(Hints : 1, Use Absolute positioning to position the image. 2, Use setInterval/ setTimeout method to move the images)
